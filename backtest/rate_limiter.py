"""Per-provider rate limiting, shared across the whole process.

Why this exists
---------------
The E2E run (workflow 32295883751) fired ~185 LLM calls in 18 seconds, peaking
at 30 in a single second, and produced zero forecasts. The providers answered
with exactly what they meter on:

    Gemini free: quotaId "GenerateRequestsPerMinutePerProjectPerModel-FreeTier"
                 quotaValue 15          -> 15 REQUESTS per minute, per model
    Groq free:   "tokens per minute (TPM): Limit 8000, Used 5951,
                  Requested 2396"       -> 8000 TOKENS per minute

Two different meters. A semaphore fixes neither: it caps how many calls are in
flight at once, not how many happen per minute. Ten calls that each take 200ms
pass a semaphore of 2 easily and still blow a 15/minute quota.

Where it must live
------------------
`ForecastBot.get_llm(purpose)` returns one instance per ROLE, and with the
fallback active there are four of them (default, summarizer, researcher,
parser). Each holds its OWN GeneralLlm pointing at Gemini. A limiter stored on
the instance would therefore become four independent limiters allowing 60
req/min against a 15 req/min quota - the control would look present and do
nothing.

So limiters live in a process-global registry keyed by MODEL string. All four
roles, every question and every prediction share one limiter per model, which
is also the granularity Gemini actually meters ("PerProjectPerModel").

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
It delays calls. It never drops one, never shortens a prediction, and never
touches what a forecast is. A call that waits is still exactly one call; a
prediction that waits is still exactly one prediction.
