    Why this exists
    ---------------
    This repository is a PUBLIC fork, so GitHub Actions logs are world
    readable. A tournament run used to emit, in the clear: the full research
    body, the report summary and first rationale, and each of the five
    individual predictions -- for a question that was still OPEN.

    Two distinct problems, one cause:

      * Metaculus requires bots to leave PRIVATE comments, published later at
        Metaculus' own intervals. Publishing the same reasoning immediately in
        a public log defeats that, whatever the log's medium.
      * FutureEval forbids a bot maker from previewing their bot's forecasts on
        open questions and then updating the bot. Printing the predictions puts
        that preview in front of the maker on every run. Removing it makes the
        guarantee structural instead of a promise -- the same reasoning that
        keeps research/ limited to closed questions.

    It redacts CONTENT, never the fact that work happened: the question URL,
    the call counts, the provider and bucket lines and the publication
    confirmations all survive, so operational auditing is unaffected.

    Not applied in test_questions mode: bot-testing-area is an unscored
    practice area, and full output there is what makes it useful.
